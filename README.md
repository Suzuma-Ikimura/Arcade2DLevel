## About

This little level was designed to demonstrate C# programming skills in Unity 3D. 
The main tasks that were implemented: the main menu, choosing between two characters, controlling the character, reacting to traps and moving to the original position, reacting to traps, connecting animations, moving the enemy creature on a given trajectory from obstacle to obstacle.
The program code is divided into several scripts, allowing you to quickly customize or change it.
